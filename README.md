## Making Space
An AppalHack project by **Colin Tiller**

## Requirements
Download requirements with the following:
> `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Results:
I was able to achieve my goal of making a generative space 'simulation'!
By running the `procedural_generation.py` script, you can try it for yourself using
WASD controls, and looking around with your mouse.

This project was made in 24 hours, with no prior experience of Panda3D -- thank you to the event directors for putting on such a great event!

Thank you to the judges for making me an honorable mention! As a solo, competing against teams of 4
was challenging, but still earning a "place" is an honor.
